# Day16 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is a **Dribbble Website Clone**, created as part of the **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
It replicates the **project showcase layout of [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)** using **HTML and CSS**, focusing on flexbox layouts, hover overlays, and responsive design.

## 📌 About the Project
The task was to design a **creative project showcase webpage** similar to Dribbble’s design section, including:

- 🖼 Multiple cards displaying **images or videos**

- 🎥 Hover overlay revealing **project title**, **Save**, and **Like** buttons  
- 🧭 Flexbox layout with wrapping for responsive display  
- ⚡ Smooth hover transitions and clean modern styling  

This project helped me understand:
